# Debian 12 customizations via bash scripts
The scripts are intended to help with various customizations such as adding the most important repositories, various desktop environments or programs.

## Flexibility
The individual scripts contain several of the most important tools and ask you which ones should be installed. This allows you to simply skip unwanted programs.

## Reproducibility
If you always install the same tools on multiple PCs, you can ensure that all PCs have been configured and installed identically.
